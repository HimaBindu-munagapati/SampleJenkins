# Jenkins Sample Java Project

This repository contains a simple Jenkins project created using Java. It serves as a basic example of how to set up a Java project in Jenkins with a sample `pom.xml` configuration for Maven builds or a Gradle script.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes the following files:

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git to keep the repository clean.
- **`misc.xml`**: Configuration file for your IDE.
- **`modules.xml`**: Configuration file for your Java module.
- **`pom.xml`** (if Maven is used) or **`build.gradle`** (if Gradle is used): Build configuration file for the project (not currently listed, but should be added).
- **`src/`**: Directory containing the source code for the Java project.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation file (this file) to help understand the project setup and configuration.

## Project Configuration

This sample project was created using Java and structured with the following XML configuration file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<module type="JAVA_MODULE" version="4">
  <component name="NewModuleRootManager" inherit-compiler-output="true">
    <exclude-output />
    <content url="file://$MODULE_DIR$">
      <sourceFolder url="file://$MODULE_DIR$/src" isTestSource="false" />
    </content>
    <orderEntry type="inheritedJdk" />
    <orderEntry type="sourceFolder" forTests="false" />
  </component>
</module>
```

The module configuration specifies the source folder structure and JDK settings for the project.

## Setting Up the Project

To set up this project in Jenkins:

1. **Create a new Jenkins project**:
   - Go to your Jenkins dashboard and click on **New Item**.
   - Enter a project name and select **Freestyle project** or **Pipeline**, depending on your preference.
   
2. **Configure the project**:
   - If you are using **Freestyle**, add the build step for Maven/Gradle, and set the path to your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.
   - If you are using **Pipeline**, create a `Jenkinsfile` with the necessary stages for building and testing your Java application.

3. **Add the Source Code**:
   - Make sure to add your repository in Jenkins by selecting **Source Code Management** and adding the Git repository URL.
   - Configure build triggers if required (e.g., on SCM changes or a periodic schedule).

4. **Build and Test**:
   - Save the project and click **Build Now** to start the build process.
   - Check the console output for build logs and any potential errors.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Compile and run the project using Maven/Gradle:

   For Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   For Gradle:

   ```bash
   gradle build
   ```

3. View the build logs and outputs to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Future Enhancements

- **Implement Unit Tests**: Add JUnit or TestNG for automated testing.
- **Integrate with Jenkins Pipeline**: Create a `Jenkinsfile` for advanced CI/CD automation.
- **Dockerize**: Build a Docker image for containerized deployment.
